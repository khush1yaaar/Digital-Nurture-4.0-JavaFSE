Answers to SME Questions:
What happens in the controller method?

The method loads the Spring application context from the XML file

Retrieves the "in" bean (which is a Country object) from the context

Returns the Country object which is automatically converted to JSON

How the bean is converted into JSON response?

Spring Boot automatically converts the returned Java object to JSON using Jackson library

The @RestController annotation enables this automatic conversion
